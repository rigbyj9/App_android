# Overview

I created this app in hopes to get an idea of how mobile applications are created and designed. This has been a field that 
I have looked into for a possible/future career.

This app that I've created is a simple color guessing game. The color will appear on the screen, and the user
will type out the color and submit it.

I wanted to start my app creating adventure with something simple, but I also wanted to make something that can
be used to educate (mostly young children)
